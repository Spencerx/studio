! Running RaptorJIT code

Here are some examples of how to run Lua code in the RaptorJIT virtual machine and inspect the resulting logs.

Run a snippet of Lua code:

[[[
RaptorJIT eval: '
for i = 1, 1000000000 do
  x = i
end
'
]]]

Run a Lua source file:

[[[
RaptorJIT runPath: '/dir/foo.lua'
]]]

Run *.lua at the top-level of a directory:

[[[
RaptorJIT runPath: '/some/dir'
]]]

Download, unpack, and run *.lua from a tarball:

[[[
RaptorJIT runURL: 'http://example.com/foo.tar.gz'
]]]
