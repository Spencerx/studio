# Studio

Studio is a debugger for the data produced by complex applications.
Studio imports dense and "messy" data in an application's own native
formats, then it applies all the tools that are needed to extract
useful information, and finally it presents the results in an
interactive graphical user interface.

Learn more in the draft [Studio
manual](https://hydra.snabb.co/job/lukego/studio-manual/studio-manual-html/latest/download-by-type/file/Manual) fresh from the master branch.

Studio is very new. It is based on a [Pharo](http://pharo.org/)
frontend and a [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) backend. The first
supported applications are
[RaptorJIT](https://github.com/raptorjit/raptorjit) and
[Snabb](https://github.com/snabbco/snabb) but there is room for
hundreds more. Early adopters welcome!
